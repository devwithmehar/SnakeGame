## Description

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java with the Swing library. It features a simple graphical user interface where the player controls a snake that moves around the board, eats food, and grows longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game board boundaries.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac App.java SnakeGame.java
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java App.java
   ```

## Controls

- **Up Arrow:** Move the snake upward
- **Down Arrow:** Move the snake downward
- **Left Arrow:** Move the snake to the left
- **Right Arrow:** Move the snake to the right

## Game Rules

- The snake starts with a single segment (head).
- The snake grows longer by eating red food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the board boundaries.
- The score is determined by the length of the snake.

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing Library (Included in Java Standard Edition)
